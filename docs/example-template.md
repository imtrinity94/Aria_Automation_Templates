- **vm_name**: Sets the virtual machineâ€™s name. The default is `my-vm`, but it can be changed.
- **cpu_count**: Determines the number of CPUs, with a default value of `2`. This can be adjusted from `1` to `8`.

### Resources
Resources are key components of the deployment:
- **Cloud_Machine**: Represents the VM to be provisioned. Key properties are:
  - **name**: Taken from the `vm_name` input.
  - **cpuCount**: Adjusted through the `cpu_count` input.
  - **image**: Uses `ubuntu-20.04` as the base operating system.
  
- **Cloud_Network**: Defines the network configuration, set to use an existing network type.

This template provides a straightforward approach to VM deployment, which can be expanded based on specific project needs.
